\SecDef{spec}{Specification of \aCipher{}, \hash{} and \aead{}}

In this section, I describe in brief the specification of the cryptographic primitives that we designed. For the up-to-date specification and information about the suite I refer to the website~\cite{sparkle-site}.

The empty bitstring is denoted $\epsilon$. The algorithms assume the byte order to be little-endian. ``$+$'' denotes the addition modulo $2^{32}$.
