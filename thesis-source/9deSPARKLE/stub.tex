In this chapter, I will describe a suite of symmetric-key algorithms. SPARKLE is a family of three cryptographic permutations motivated by the SPARX design. ESCH is a family of two hash functions build using the sponge construction and the SPARKLE permutations. SCHWAEMM is a family of authenticated encryption algorithms.
% built using the recent Beetle sponge-based mode and the SPARKLE permutations.
I performed various analysis of the SPARKLE permutation and its components, including nonlinear invariant analysis, a linearization study of the ARX-based S-Box, evaluation of resistance against integral attacks using MILP-aided bit-based division property. Furthermore, I propose a generic algorithm for building the matrix of transitions of truncated differential trails through the linear layer. The algorithm takes as input the binary matrix of the linear layer and computes precise probabilities. The advantage of this method is that it automatically takes into account all dependencies between computations in the linear layer, helping to avoid possible mistakes. Finally, I propose several attacks on reduced-round versions of SCHWAEMM.
The suite of primitives is submitted to the NIST Call for Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms~\cite{NISTlight}. It is a joint work with Christof Beierle, Alex Biryukov, Luan Cardoso dos Santos, Johann Großschädl, Léo Perrin, Vesselin Velichkov and Qingju Wang.
