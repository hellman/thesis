Almost Perfect Non-linear (APN) permutations are bijective S-Boxes with optimal resistance against differential cryptanalysis. The existence of APN permutations in even dimensions was a long-standing problem until Dillon~\etal{} discovered a 6-bit APN permutation~\cite{DillonAPN,DillonPres} and presented it in 2009. Since then, no new APN permutation with even number of bits were discovered, neither their existence was disproved. This question remains a big open problem in the field of Boolean functions. In this chapter, I describe an application of S-Box reverse-engineering methods to the only known APN permutation in even dimension. As a result, a simple algebraic structure of the Dillon's permutation is discovered, which we call the \emph{Butterfly} structure. The result leads to much simpler representations of the permutation, which are further generalized to higher dimensions. Though, no new APN permutations are found.

This chapter highlights the usefulness of the S-Box reverse-engineering methods for obtaining decompositions of S-Boxes.
