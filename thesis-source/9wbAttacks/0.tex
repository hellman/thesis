In this chapter, I describe several automated attacks on white-box implementations. It is assumed that the analyzed white-box implementation is protected by some masking scheme, in a rather general sense. The main goal is not to break existing implementations, but to discover properties that a secure obfuscation scheme has to satisfy. This chapter is based on the first part of~\cite{OurWhitebox}, a joint work with Alex Biryukov.
