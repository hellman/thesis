\SecDef{framework}{Framework for Algebraically Security}

The algebraic attack is very powerful and the classic \txor{}-sharing masking schemes can not withstand it. Therefore, it is important to develop new masking schemes which are secure against the algebraic attack. In this section I describe a formalization of security against the algebraic attack and a provably first-order secure construction. 

I start by discussing the attack model in \SecRef{model}. A formal game-based security definition is given in \SecRef{prediction}. Ways of proving security in the new model are developed in \SecRef{security}. Next, the composability is studied in \SecRef{construction}. An algorithm for checking security of gadgets is proposed in \SecRef{verify}.
