In this chapter, I describe distinguishing and decomposition attacks against Feistel networks. It is based on a part of the joint work with Alex Biryukov and Léo Perrin~\cite{OurKuz1} and on the joint work with Léo Perrin~\cite{OurFeistel}. The first paper describes a structure inside the S-Box used in the Russian cryptographic standards and the method is generalized into a decomposition attack against 3- and 4- round Feistel Networks composed with random affine mappings. The second paper analyzes the method more deeply. It gives many insights into algebraic degeneracies in Feistel Networks and describes how to exploit such artifacts to mount distinguishing and decomposition attacks. This analysis and the generalization is described in this chapter, and the GOST S-Box decomposition is described in \ChapRef{kuz}.
