In this chapter, I show a study of linear layers that preserve all low-degree invariants of a particular form. It is a generalization of \emph{orthogonal} linear layers, which preserve all quadratic invariants, exploited in~\cite{NonlinInv}. Our main result is that for cubic invariants, there is no such \emph{bijective} linear map that preserves all of them. However, we exhibit such \emph{expanding} linear maps. We study the minimum expansion rate of these maps. This is a joint work with Christof Beierle and Alex Biryukov and it is currently in a process of submission to a Boolean functions journal.
