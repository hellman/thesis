In this chapter, I describe the \sparx{} family of block ciphers. It is a joint work with my coauthors Daniel Dinu, LÃ©o Perrin, Vesselin Velichkov, Johann Gro{\ss}sch\"{a}dl, and Alex Biryukov~\cite{OurSPARX}. \sparx{} is the first ARX-based block cipher with provable security against linear and differential cryptanalysis. The design is a motivated by the novel \emph{long-trail strategy}. My contributions are designing an algorithm for long-trail evaluation, evaluation of potential linear layers and integral cryptanalysis based on division property.
