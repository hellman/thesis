In this chapter, I describe the necessary background required to understand the thesis, as well as notations and definitions used. The framework of Boolean functions is extensively used. The contents of this chapter are rather dense and cover only the notions used in this thesis. For a more detailed source about Boolean functions, I refer to~\cite{Carlet,CarletVectorial}.

Common mathematical notations are used. The notation $\eqdef$ means ``by definition''. $\ZZ$ denotes the set of integers, $\ZZplus$ denotes the set of positive integers, $\ZZzeroplus \eqdef \pset{0} \cup \ZZplus$ denotes the set of non-negative integers. For $n \in \ZZplus$, $\ZZn{n}$ denotes the set $\pset{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1}$. 
For $a,b \in \ZZ, a\le b$, $\seg{a}{b}$ denotes the tuple of integers $(a, a+1, \ldots, b-1, b)$.
$\sumbinom{n}{k}$ denotes the sum $\sum_{i=0}^{k}\binom{n}{i}$.
